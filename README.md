loaf train tool

for anyone looking at this that's confused
this is a small JS canvas app with a python backend that simulates part of the Savage Raid Eden 3 from Final Fantasy XIV
it's basically a practice tool for my raid group so we can continuously work on challenging parts of the fight without having to do the easy parts to get there every time we wipe

it's up here if you want to look at it: https://evening-dawn-49597.herokuapp.com/
8 people connect and input their names and roles, then can simulate handling fight mechanics

notes:
1. your name must be "raimi" to use master commands
2. master commands include E for pause, F for start / reset
3. the mechanic assumes 4 dps, 2 tanks, 2 healers
